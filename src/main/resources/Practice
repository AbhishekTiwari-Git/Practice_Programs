Junit Parallel :
    - Feature Files are executed in parallel instead of Scenarios and Scenario Outline
    - With Maven SureFire Plugin :
        ~ Runner class should be named as *Test.java for e.g. RunCucumberTest.java
        ~ Add Configuration
            <parallel>methods</parallel>
            <threadCount>4</threadCount>
    - With Maven Fail Safe Plugin :
        ~ Runner class should be named as *IT.java for e.g. RunCucumberIT.java
        ~ Add Configuration
            <parallel>methods</parallel>
            <threadCount>4</threadCount>

TestNG Parallel :
    - In TestNG Scenarios are executed in Parallel mode.
    - Extend the Runner class with AbstractTestNGCucumberTests class
    - Override Scenario Method
    - Set DataProvider parallel to true for e.g.
    class RunnerTest extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests{
    @Override
    @DataProvide(parallel = true)
    public Object[][] scenarios(){
    return super.scenarios();
    }
    }

Reporting :
Extent Report :

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)

    features = {"/src/resources/features"},
    glue = {"/stepDefinition"},
    plugin = {"pretty","avenstack cucumber report adapter:"},
    tags = {"smoke"}
    )

    public class TestRunner(){
    }
